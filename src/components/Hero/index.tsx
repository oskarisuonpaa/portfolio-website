        <p>
          I'm a software engineering student at the Lappeenranta-Lahti
          University of Technology LUT and information and communication
          technologies student at the LAB University of Applied Sciences. I'm
          passionate about all types of technology and I'm always looking for
          new challenges. My primary interests are in game development and all
          things related to AI. I'm also interested in web development and I
          have experience in both frontend and backend development, though I
          prefer the latter. I have knowledge of a wide variety of programming
          languages and technologies. I'm always looking for new opportunities
          to learn and grow as a developer. After I have completed my bachelor's
          degree, I'm planning to continue my studies in the field of systems
          and services development in the master's degree program at LUT.
